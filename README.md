# Database as a service 

In this assignment, I am going to talk about the potential future of database services as many services move to the cloud as: (insert word here) as a service. In this case, we are going to be looking at database as a service (DBaaS).

## What is DBaaS 
Venture Beat introduces [Database as a Service](https://venturebeat.com/2021/01/25/what-is-database-as-a-service/) as a solution to the traditional method of buying, installing and maintaining computer systems. In this business model, companies allow you to store your data and retrieve them from anywhere in the world without having physical access to the hardware used to store it. They do this, usually, at a fraction of the price needed to set up your personal data storage systems. 

Many companies are taking part in this cloud solution of offering database services, including Google, Amazon and Microsoft. You can get access to some of the traditional database systems such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, although they may have their own tweaks to improve the speeds at which you can access your data. Another advantage is that of scaling, whereby you can easily rent more space using the service to respond to a growing customer base rather than having to go out and buy new hardware and configure it. 

However, this model may prove to be incredibly expensive if you have massive amounts of data that needs to be stored for long periods of time. Especially given that prices increase as you require faster data access speeds. In this case, it is preferable to set up a physical storage solution for cost-savings in the long run. 

From an average consumer and developer perspective, I think that offerting DBaaS is an excellent way for people to not worry about setting up an entire system before being able to release their appication onto the internet. 

## MongoDB's RealmSync application
[RealmSync](https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/02/mongodb-launches-realm-sync-to-keep-data-synchronized-between-mobile-and-the-cloud/) is an application provided by MongoDB, a non-relational database system, that allows data to be synched between devices, users and the backend. This is especially useful for the MongoDB Atlas, which is the cloud solution (DBaaS) provided by MongoDB. MongoDB Atlas is available on renowned cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. 

This application helps offline-first apps to move some of the data from the server to the user's device. This allows for a faster user experience especially when there is slower network speeds. With the automatic sync capabilities, data is automatically transferred to the cloud whenever there is a stable network connection. This allows data to synced across all platforms for the user. 

As a user of services like Google cloud, I would like see the files in my drive and the photos on my phone, load faster for offline access whilst still maintaining the reliability of a backup in the cloud.
